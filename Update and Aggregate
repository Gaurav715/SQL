Update and Aggregate

1.Change the “Business Analysis” department name to “Data Analysis”.
select * from 
departments;

UPDATE departments
SET 
    dept_name = 'Data Analysis'
    
where dept_no ='d010';

2.Remove the department number 10 record from the “departments” table.

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    departments;
    
    
    DELETE FROM departments 
WHERE
    dept_no = 'd010';
    
      Rollback;
	  

3.How many departments are there in the “employees” database? Use the ‘dept_emp’ table to answer the question

SELECT 
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    dept_emp;
	
4.What is the total amount of money spent on salaries for all contracts starting after the 1st of January 1997?

SELECT 
    SUM(salary)
FROM
    salaries
WHERE
    from_date = '1997-01-01';
	
	
5. Which is the lowest employee number in the database?

6. Which is the highest employee number in the database?

select MAX(emp_no) from employees
select MIN(emp_no) from employees

7.What is the average annual salary paid to employees who started after the 1st of January 1997?

select avg(salary)
from salaries 
where from_date > '1997-01-01';


8.Round the average amount of money spent on salaries for all contracts that started after the 1st of January 1997 to a precision of cents.
select round(avg(salary),2)
from salaries 
where from_date > '1997-01-01';

9.Select the department number and name from the ‘departments_dup’
table and add a third column where you name the department number (‘dept_no’) as ‘dept_info’. 
If ‘dept_no’ does not have a value, use ‘dept_name’.


select dept_no, dept_name
colease(dept_no,dept_name) as dept_info
from departments,
order by dept_no ASC;


10.Modify the code obtained from the previous exercise in the following way.
 Apply the IFNULL() function to the values from the first and second column,
 so that ‘N/A’ is displayed whenever a department number has no value, and 
 ‘Department name not provided’ is shown if there is no value for ‘dept_name’.
 
 SELECT
    IFNULL(dept_no, 'N/A') as dept_no,
    IFNULL(dept_name,
            'Department name not provided') AS dept_name,
    COALESCE(dept_no, dept_name) AS dept_info
FROM
    departments_dup
ORDER BY dept_no ASC;
